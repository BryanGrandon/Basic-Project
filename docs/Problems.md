## The famous Fizz Buzz.

Write a program that displays by console the numbers from 1 to 100 (both included with a line break between each print), substituting the following:

- Multiples of 3 by the word "fizz".
- Multiples of 5 for the word "buzz".
- Multiples of 3 and 5 at the same time for the word "fizzbuzz".

## Is it an anagram?

Write a function that receives two words (String) and returns true or false (Bool) depending on whether they are anagrams or not.

An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another initial word.

- It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
- Two words that are exactly the same are not anagrams.

## The Fibonacci sequence.

Write a program that prints the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence starting at 0.

The Fibonacci series is composed by a succession of numbers in which the next one is always the sum of the two previous ones.

-  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

## Is it a prime number?

Write a program to check if a number is prime or not.
Once this is done, print the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

## Inverse text string

Create a program that inverts the order of a text string without using language functions that do it automatically.
 - If we pass “Hello world” it would return “dlrow olleH”.

## Decimal to Binary

Create a program to transform a decimal number to binary without using language functions that do it directly.

## Morse code

Create a program that is able to transform natural text to Morse code and vice versa. It should automatically detect what type it is and perform the conversion.

## Balanced statements

Creates a program that checks if the parentheses, braces and brackets in an expression are balanced.

Balanced means that these delimiters are opened and closed in order and correctly.

- Parentheses, braces and square brackets are of equal priority. No one is more important than the other.
- Balanced expression: { [ a * ( c + d ) ] - 5 }
- Unbalanced expression: { a * ( c + d ) ] - 5 }

## Is a palindrome

Write a function that receives a text and returns true or false (Boolean) depending on whether or not they are palindromes.

A palindrome is a word or expression that is the same whether it is read from left to right or right to left.

- Spaces, punctuation marks and accents are NOT taken into account.
- Example: Ana takes the hazelnut to the bear.

## Recursive factorial

Write a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number recursively.

- Example: 5! = 120

## It's an Armstrong number

 Write a function that calculates whether a given number is an Armstrong number.
