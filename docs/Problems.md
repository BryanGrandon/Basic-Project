## Is it an anagram?

Write a function that receives two words (String) and returns true or false (Bool) depending on whether they are anagrams or not.

An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another initial word.

- It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
- Two words that are exactly the same are not anagrams.
