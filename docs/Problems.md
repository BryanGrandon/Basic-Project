## The famous Fizz Buzz.

Write a program that displays by console the numbers from 1 to 100 (both included with a line break between each print), substituting the following:

- Multiples of 3 by the word "fizz".
- Multiples of 5 for the word "buzz".
- Multiples of 3 and 5 at the same time for the word "fizzbuzz".

## Is it an anagram?

Write a function that receives two words (String) and returns true or false (Bool) depending on whether they are anagrams or not.

An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another initial word.

- It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
- Two words that are exactly the same are not anagrams.

## The Fibonacci sequence.

Write a program that prints the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence starting at 0.

The Fibonacci series is composed by a succession of numbers in which the next one is always the sum of the two previous ones.

-  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

## Is it a prime number?

Write a program to check if a number is prime or not.
Once this is done, print the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

## Inverse text string

Create a program that inverts the order of a text string without using language functions that do it automatically.
 - If we pass “Hello world” it would return “dlrow olleH”.
